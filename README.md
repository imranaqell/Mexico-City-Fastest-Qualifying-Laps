## Mexico City GP: Two of the Fastest Pole Position around Mexico City

**Analysis**

This mini project compares the two fastest pole positions, which were set in 2018 by Daniel Ricciardo and 2019 by Charles Leclerc. The gap between those two pole positions was just a little over quarter a second which is quite significant in the world of Formula 1.

Charles Leclerc was able to gain a lot of time in the straights with the controversial Ferrari SF90, with a top speed reaching over 350 km/h while Daniel Ricciardo in his Red Bull RB14 barely surpassed 340 km/h. Despite the straight line advantage of the Ferrari, it is important to remember that the RB14 is a high drag car which performs best on high altitude tracks. Daniel Ricciardo was able to maintain higher speeds in every curve and brake much later compared to Charles Leclerc.

**High Drag = Faster on High Altitude Tracks?**

The Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez is situated in the south-eastern part of Mexico City's center, and it has a slightly lower ambient pressure of 780hPa compared to the usual sea level pressure of around 1,000hPa, making it approximately 20% less. Despite being located at a high altitude, this track is known for its relatively minimal elevation change, with a difference of just under 3 meters between its lowest and highest points. This can be attributed, in part, to Mexico City being situated in the 'Valley of Mexico', which was once a lakebed.

Altitude has an impact on various activities, such as going for a run in Mexico City or utilizing a turbocharger to enhance the engine of a car. This correlation is attributed to the quantity of air particles and the air density at a particular elevation. As you ascend in the atmosphere, the air becomes progressively less dense. This occurs due to the weight of the air, which causes compression closer to sea level resulting in a higher concentration of air particles. At an elevation of 2,285 meters above sea level, the air density is approximately 25% lower than at sea level, consequently leading to a reduction of oxygen by a quarter.

As discussed earlier, higher drag cars shine bright on high altitude tracks. There are many factors to back up this statement. The one factor that we will be focusing on is that higher drag cars can take advantage of the lower air density. This results in reduced drag on the car because there's less air resistance to slow it down. Since the RB14 is a high drag car, setup is much easier, while other teams have to create a setup in which they sacrifice a lot of performance in other parts of the car to gain downforce.
